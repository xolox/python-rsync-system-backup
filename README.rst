The rsync-system-backup program uses rsync_ to create full system backups of
Linux_ systems. Supported backup destinations include local disks (possibly
encrypted using LUKS_) and remote systems that are running an SSH_ server or
`rsync daemon`_. Each backup produces a timestamped snapshot and these
snapshots are rotated according to a rotation scheme that you can configure.
The package is currently tested on cPython 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and PyPy
(2.7).

Status
------

While this project brings together more than ten years of experience in
creating (system) backups using rsync_, all of the actual Python code was
written in the first few months of 2017 and has seen limited real world use.
The project does however have an automated test suite with more than 90% test
coverage and my intention is to extend the test coverage further.

In May 2018 I changed the status from alpha to beta as part of release 1.0. The
bump in major version number was triggered by a backwards incompatible code
change, however at that point I had been using `rsync-system-backup` to make
local backups of several of my Linux systems for the majority of a year. Also
several colleagues of mine have used the how-to on setting up unattended
backups to an encrypted USB disk.

.. warning:: Please use the ``--dry-run`` option when you're getting familiar
             with how `rsync-system-backup` works and don't remove the option
             until you're confident that you have the right command line,
             because using `rsync-system-backup` in the wrong way can cause
             data loss (for example by accidentally swapping the ``SOURCE``
             and ``DESTINATION`` arguments).

Installation
------------

The `rsync-system-backup` package is available on PyPI_ which means
installation should be as simple as:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install rsync-system-backup

There's actually a multitude of ways to install Python packages (e.g. the `per
user site-packages directory`_, `virtual environments`_ or just installing
system wide) and I have no intention of getting into that discussion here, so
if this intimidates you then read up on your options before returning to these
instructions ;-).

Usage
-----

There are two ways to use the `rsync-system-backup` package: As the command
line program ``rsync-system-backup`` and as a Python API. For details about the
Python API please refer to the API documentation available on `Read the Docs`_.
The command line interface is described below.

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. A DRY solution to avoid duplication of the `rsync-system-backup --help' text:
..
.. [[[cog
.. from humanfriendly.usage import inject_usage
.. inject_usage('rsync_system_backup.cli')
.. ]]]

**Usage:** `rsync-system-backup [OPTIONS] [SOURCE] DESTINATION`

Use rsync to create full system backups.

The required DESTINATION argument specifies the (possibly remote) location
where the backup is stored, in the syntax of rsync's command line interface.
The optional SOURCE argument defaults to '/' which means the complete root
filesystem will be included in the backup (other filesystems are excluded).

Please use the ``--dry-run`` option when getting familiar with this program and
don't remove it until you're confident that you have the right command line,
because using this program in the wrong way can cause data loss (for example
by accidentally swapping the SOURCE and DESTINATION arguments).

Supported locations include:

- Local disks (possibly encrypted using LUKS).
- Remote systems that allow SSH connections.
- Remote systems that are running an rsync daemon.
- Connections to rsync daemons tunneled over SSH.

The backup process consists of several steps:

1. First rsync is used to transfer all (relevant) files to a destination
   directory (whether on the local system or a remote system). Every time
   a backup is made, this same destination directory is updated.

2. After the files have been transferred a 'snapshot' of the destination
   directory is taken and stored in a directory with a timestamp in its
   name. These snapshots are created using 'cp ``--archive`` ``--link``'.

3. Finally the existing snapshots are rotated to purge old backups
   according to a rotation scheme that you can customize.

**Supported options:**

.. csv-table::
   :header: Option, Description
   :widths: 30, 70


   "``-b``, ``--backup``","Create a backup using rsync but don't create a snapshot and don't rotate
   old snapshots unless the ``--snapshot`` and/or ``--rotate`` options are also given."
   "``-s``, ``--snapshot``","Create a snapshot of the destination directory but don't create a backup
   and don't rotate old snapshots unless the ``--backup`` and/or ``--rotate`` options
   are also given.
   
   This option can be used to create snapshots of an rsync daemon module using
   a 'post-xfer exec' command. If DESTINATION isn't given it defaults to the
   value of the environment variable ``$RSYNC_MODULE_PATH``."
   "``-r``, ``--rotate``","Rotate old snapshots but don't create a backup and snapshot unless the
   ``--backup`` and/or ``--snapshot`` options are also given.
   
   This option can be used to rotate old snapshots of an rsync daemon module
   using a 'post-xfer exec' command. If DESTINATION isn't given it defaults to
   the value of the environment variable ``$RSYNC_MODULE_PATH``."
   "``-m``, ``--mount=DIRECTORY``","Automatically mount the filesystem to which backups are written.
   
   When this option is given and ``DIRECTORY`` isn't already mounted, the
   'mount' command is used to mount the filesystem to which backups are
   written before the backup starts. When 'mount' was called before the
   backup started, 'umount' will be called when the backup finishes.
   
   An entry for the mount point needs to be
   defined in /etc/fstab for this to work."
   "``-c``, ``--crypto=NAME``","Automatically unlock the encrypted filesystem to which backups are written.
   
   When this option is given and the ``NAME`` device isn't already unlocked, the
   cryptdisks_start command is used to unlock the encrypted filesystem to
   which backups are written before the backup starts. When cryptdisks_start
   was called before the backup started, cryptdisks_stop will be called
   when the backup finishes.
   
   An entry for the encrypted filesystem needs to be defined in /etc/crypttab
   for this to work. If the device of the encrypted filesystem is missing and
   rsync-system-backup is being run non-interactively, it will exit gracefully
   and not show any desktop notifications.
   
   If you want the backup process to run fully unattended you can configure a
   key file in /etc/crypttab, otherwise you will be asked for the password
   each time the encrypted filesystem is unlocked."
   "``-t``, ``--tunnel=TUNNEL_SPEC``","Connect to an rsync daemon through an SSH tunnel. This provides encryption
   for rsync client to daemon connections that are not otherwise encrypted.
   The value of ``TUNNEL_SPEC`` is expected to be an SSH alias, host name or IP
   address. Optionally a username can be prefixed (followed by '@') and/or a
   port number can be suffixed (preceded by ':')."
   "``-i``, ``--ionice=CLASS``","Use the 'ionice' program to set the I/O scheduling class and priority of
   the 'rm' invocations used to remove backups. ``CLASS`` is expected to be one of
   the values 'idle', 'best-effort' or 'realtime'. Refer to the man page of
   the 'ionice' program for details about these values."
   "``-u``, ``--no-sudo``","By default backup and snapshot creation is performed with superuser
   privileges, to ensure that all files are readable and filesystem
   metadata is preserved. The ``-u``, ``--no-sudo`` option disables
   the use of 'sudo' during these operations."
   "``-n``, ``--dry-run``","Don't make any changes, just report what would be done. This doesn't
   create a backup or snapshot but it does run rsync with the ``--dry-run``
   option."
   ``--multi-fs``,"Allow rsync to cross filesystem boundaries. This option has the opposite
   effect of the rsync option ``--one-file-system`` because rsync-system-backup
   defaults to running rsync with ``--one-file-system`` and must be instructed
   not to using ``--multi-fs``."
   "``-x``, ``--exclude=PATTERN``","Selectively exclude certain files from being included in the backup.
   Refer to the rsync documentation for allowed ``PATTERN`` syntax. Note that
   rsync-system-backup always uses the 'rsync ``--one-file-system``' option."
   "``-f``, ``--force``","By default rsync-system-backup refuses to run on non-Linux systems because
   it was designed specifically for use on Linux. The use of the ``-f``, ``--force``
   option sidesteps this sanity check. Please note that you are on your own if
   things break!"
   ``--disable-notifications``,"By default a desktop notification is shown (using notify-send) before the
   system backup starts and after the backup finishes. The use of this option
   disables the notifications (notify-send will not be called at all)."

How it works
------------

I've been finetuning my approach to Linux system backups for years now and
during that time rsync_ has become my swiss army knife of choice :-). I also
believe that comprehensive documentation can be half the value of an open
source project. The following sections attempt to provide a high level
overview of my system backup strategy:

.. contents::
   :depth: 1
   :local:

The (lack of) backup format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each backup is a full copy of the filesystem tree, stored in the form of
individual files and directories on the destination. This "backup format" makes
it really easy to navigate through and recover from backups because you can use
whatever method you are comfortable with, whether that is a file browser,
terminal, Python_ script or even chroot_ :-).

.. note:: You may want to configure updatedb_ to exclude the directory
          containing your system backups, otherwise the locate_ database
          will grow enormously.

Snapshots and hard links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every time a backup is made the same destination directory is updated with
additions, updates and deletions since the last backup. After the backup is
done a snapshot of the destination directory is created using the command ``cp
--archive --link`` with the current date and time encoded in the name.

Due to the use of `hard links`_ each "version" of a file is only stored once.
Because rsync_ by default doesn't modify files inplace it breaks `hard links`_
and thereby avoids modifying existing inodes_. This ensures that the contents
of snapshots don't change when a new backup updates existing files. The
combination of hard links and the avoidance of inplace modifications
effectively provides a limited form of deduplication_. Each snapshot requires a
couple of megabytes to store the directory names and hard links but the
contents of files aren't duplicated.

The article `Easy Automated Snapshot-Style Backups with Linux and Rsync`_
contains more details about this technique.

Rotation of snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapshots can be rotated according to a flexible rotation scheme, for example
I've configured my laptop backup rotation to preserve the most recent 24 hourly
backups, 30 daily backups and endless monthly backups.

Backup destinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While developing, maintaining and evolving backup scripts for various Linux
laptops and servers I've learned that backups for different systems require
different backup destinations and connection methods:

.. contents::
   :local:

Encrypted USB disks
+++++++++++++++++++

There's a LUKS_ encrypted USB disk on my desk at work that I use to keep
hourly, daily and monthly backups of my work laptop. The disk is connected
through the same USB hub that also connects my keyboard and mouse so I can't
really forget about it :-).

Automatic mounting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the backup starts, the encrypted disk is automatically unlocked and
mounted. The use of a key file enables this process to run unattended in the
background. Once the backup is done the disk will be unmounted and locked
again, so that it can be unplugged at any time (as long as a backup isn't
running of course).

Local server (rsync daemon)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

My personal laptop transfers hourly backups to the `rsync daemon`_ running on
the server in my home network using a direct TCP connection without SSH. Most
of the time the laptop has an USB Ethernet adapter connected but the backup
runs fine over a wireless connection as well.

Remote server (rsync daemon over SSH tunnel)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

My VPS (virtual private server) transfers nightly backups to the `rsync
daemon`_ running on the server in my home network over an `SSH tunnel`_ in
order to encrypt the traffic and restrict access. The SSH account is configured
to allow tunneling but disallow command execution. This setup enables the rsync
client and server to run with root privileges without allowing the client to
run arbitrary commands on the server.

Alternative connection methods
------------------------------

Backing up to a local disk limits the effectiveness of backups but using SSH
access between systems gives you more than you bargained for, because you're
allowing arbitrary command execution. The `rsync daemon`_ provides an
alternative that does not allow arbitrary command execution. The following
sections discuss this option in more detail.

Using rsync daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to write files as root and preserve all filesystem metadata, rsync
must be running with root privileges. However most of my backups are stored on
remote systems and opening up remote root access over SSH just to transfer
backups feels like a very blunt way to solve the problem :-).

Fortunately another solution is available: Configure an rsync daemon on the
destination and instruct your rsync client to connect to the rsync daemon
instead of connecting to the remote system over SSH. The rsync daemon
configuration can restrict the access of the rsync client so that it can only
write to the directory that contains the backup tree.

In this setup no SSH connections are used and the traffic between the rsync
client and server is not encrypted. If this is a problem for you then continue
reading the next section.

Enabling rsync daemon
+++++++++++++++++++++

On Debian and derivatives like Ubuntu you can enable and configure an `rsync
daemon`_ quite easily:

1. Make sure that rsync is installed:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo apt-get install rsync

2. Enable the rsync daemon by editing ``/etc/default/rsync`` and changing the
   line ``RSYNC_ENABLE=false`` to ``RSYNC_ENABLE=true``. Here's a one liner
   that accomplishes the task:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo sed -i 's/RSYNC_ENABLE=false/RSYNC_ENABLE=true/' /etc/default/rsync
   
3. Create the configuration file ``/etc/rsyncd.conf`` and define at least
   one module. Here's an example based on my rsync daemon configuration:

   .. code-block:: ini

      # Global settings.
      max connections = 4
      log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log

      # Defaults for modules.
      read only = no
      uid = 0
      gid = 0

      # Daily backups of my VPS.
      [vps_backups]
      path = /mnt/backups/vps/latest
      post-xfer exec = /usr/sbin/process-vps-backups

      # Hourly backups of my personal laptop.
      [laptop_backups]
      path = /mnt/backups/laptop/latest
      post-xfer exec = /usr/sbin/process-laptop-backups

   The ``post-xfer exec`` directives configure the rsync daemon to create a
   snapshot once the backup is done and rotate old snapshots afterwards.

4. Once you've created ``/etc/rsyncd.conf`` you can start the rsync daemon:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo service rsync start

5. If you're using a firewall you should make sure that the rsync daemon port
   is whitelisted to allow incoming connections. The rsync daemon port number
   defaults to 873. Here's an iptables command to accomplish this:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 873 -m comment --comment "rsync daemon" -j ACCEPT

Tunneling rsync daemon connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your backups are transferred over the public internet you should
definitely use SSH to encrypt the traffic, but if you're at all security
conscious then you probably won't like having to open up remote root access
over SSH just to transfer backups :-).

The alternative is to use a non privileged SSH account to set up an `SSH
tunnel`_ that redirects network traffic to the rsync daemon. The login shell of
the SSH account can be set to ``/usr/sbin/nologin`` (or something similar like
``/bin/false``) to `disable command execution`_, in this case you need to pass
``-N`` to the SSH client.
